# The Movie Industry in the last decades 

The movie industry has changed a lot since the 80s. Hollywood focused on the internal market and the cinema landscape was dominated by medium budget movies ( >5 and <65 current million dolars). Today big studios are almost monopolys and own the most famous franchises. Movies now have big budget, lots of VFX and they have become big events.

What happened? In this project I want to analyze economic incetives that drove this change.
